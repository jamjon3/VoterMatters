This app requires a schema which is still getting built out. Starting on the user/group auth to integrating mod_authn_dbd (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authn_dbd.html)

2011-08-04 Stubbed an inline mailer. More work to be done.
-- This will allow authorized users to compose an email directed to a group of internal users. It will allow the specification of a remote smtp (or use local)
-- This will be useful to candidates who may need to send bulk mail without a mailing list that will have custom substitutions for personalization
-- Essentially, this will function _like_ a mail merge. Considering adding something like tinymce (http://www.tinymce.com/). May consider embedding images 
-- things like that as well.
